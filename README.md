## What will this look like ?

Once a patient is diagnosed by the doctor he can then create a profile for each patien that will contain all the details of symptoms and the medical history of the patient from all of the information provided by the doctor the ai will genereate a diagnosis and provide reasoning for the diagnosis and genereate a prescription for the patient.

## What problem does this solve?

Current healthcare professionals are burdened with cases that are less severe and donâ€™t require an appointment to solve. This problem highly reduces the efficiency of the current medical system.

Doctors are overworked, and are constantly bombarded with multiple cases that ranges from extreme emergency to a paper-cut.
